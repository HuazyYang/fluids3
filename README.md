UPDATE: March 7, 2014
Fluids v.3.1 is now available on github and on project website.
This version is essentially identical, but is much easier to build. It has the following new features:
- Easier to build. No more dependency on freetype or glut.
- Interactive on-screen GUIs
- Upgraded to run on CUDA 5.0 and 5.5
- Profile timings. Now includes GPU markers for profiling on the GPU using NVIDIAâ€™s free NSight tool.
- Bug fixes noticed by users


Requirements:
-----------

Fluids v.3.1 requires a CUDA-capable NVIDIA graphics card /w Compute capability 2.1 or higher. 
Builds tested on Windows 7 with Visual Studio 2010

Start Fluids by running fluids_v3.exe
See below for License terms.
See website for software details.

Fluids 3.1 makes use of the following libraries:
 CUDA - http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home_new.html
 OpenGL - http://www.opengl.org/
 TinyXML - http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/index.html

Keyboard commands:
------------------
H		Turn scene info on/off
N, M		Change number of particles
[, ]		Change example scene (loaded from scene.xml)
F, G		Change algorithm (CPU, GPU, etc.)
J		Change rendering mode (points, sprites, spheres)
C		Adjust camera (using mouse)
L		Adjust light (using mouse)
A,S,W,D	Move camera target
1		Draw acceleration grid
2		Draw particle IDs (be sure # < 4096 first)
~		Start video capture to disk (tilde key)
-, +		Change grid density
